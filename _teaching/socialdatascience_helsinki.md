This course is designed to allow students to quantitatively answer a theory-driven research question using publicly available data that responds to their interests in either their main study track and/or their thematic pathway of study.

In this course we will learn good practices for coming up with answerable research questions, learn to conduct brief literature reviews that can inform the way we ask questions and use data, how to organize data in a variety of ways that answer different research questions, and to critically analyze this data to answer research questions of interest to students.

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1) Articulate and understand how to develop research questions that are applicable to real world situations and that are relevant to student interests.

2) Learn about and be able to access datasets on a variety of topics from the broader social sciences.

3) Students will be able to understand how theoretically informed research questions can help with designing datasets and analyses that maximize trade-offs between data parsimony and accurate representation of the social world.

4) Students will learn best practices for data visualization for a range of different data types commonly used in the social sciences.

5) Finally, students will apply the skills they have gained to manipulate and visualize data to create a research idea paper based on existing literature and data. This idea paper outlines a feasible research proposal which may entail causal claims, by drawing on correlational evidence and literature. 


*Note: the course will be taught using RStudio. Students are allowed to use their preferred programs for analysis, but the instructor cannot guarantee technical support for any programs besides R. Please ask the instructors permission for using a different analysis program and submissions for assignments are still required (but can be in the permitted program).
