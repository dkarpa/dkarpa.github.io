The course aims to prepare students for writing their bachelor's thesis. Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to select and narrow a research topic, to formulate a research question, to do a literature review, to locate descriptive data appropriate to their research question as well as they will learn how to visualize this data using R software. Students will be prepared to design and independently carry out their own research project. The focus is on teaching the ability to independently use data from various sources as a basis for argumentation to answer social science questions. This will prepare students for writing their thesis, as well as for a future career in which data analysis plays an increasingly important role. At the end of the course, students will design their own research project, and present it to their peers.
