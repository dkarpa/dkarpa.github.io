Innovation in AI
======
* Together with Michael Rochlitz and Matheus Leusin
* In this project, we try to analyse different technological trajectories of AI in different countries. We distinguish countries by their institutional frameworks (i.e. democracies vs. autocracies) and look whether there are systematic differences in AI innovation that can be linked back to existing institutions.

Chilling Effects of Digital Surveillance
======
* In this project I utilize list experiments (also known as item count technique) in order to find self-censorship induced by (digital) surveillance.


Digital Governance Solutions
======
* Together with Michael Rochlitz
* We utilize a cross-national survey experiment (n=4.000) in Estonia, Germany, the US, and Turkey in which we manipulate information available to participants regarding the possibilities of the government to abuse a digital archive with data on citizens. We find that approval rates decline when we remind participants that such an archive can be used in order to repress citizens. We further identify determinants for citizen's approval to digital governance solutions.
* You will soon be able to find a working paper here
