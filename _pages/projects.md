Assessing the interplay between repression and informational control in autocracies
======
* How do authoritarian regimes maintain their hegemony over public opinion beyond state-run media and outright repression of journalists? 
Theory and previous research suggest that surveillance practices discourage citizens from engaging in legitimate digital communication behaviors, such as expressing opinions online.
Drawing on an original survey experiment conducted in Kazakhstan in November 2023 (N=5,025), this study is able to show that citizens exposed to a text-based surveillance treatment reduce their response rate to sensitive questions by an average 3.3% while this effect is not triggered for non-sensitive questions. 
Moreover, the measured self-censorship can be traced back to an informed elite that has access to a more diverse international media environment.
This study contributes to the literature on digital authoritarianism by showing how state surveillance practices undermine political discourse which in turn contributes to authoritarian stability.

Effects of Russian language and media in Central-Asia
======
* With Andrey Tkachenko, Michael Rochlitz, Meruyert Tatkeyeva, and Galiya Sagyndykova
* Does language affinity facilitate the export of propaganda by authoritarian regimes?
Through which channels can propaganda be exported?
And what are its effects?
We study these questions with the help of six survey waves conducted in Kazakhstan between May 2021 and September 2023, as well as an original survey conducted in October 2023.
We find that for surveys conducted after February 2022, Russian-speaking respondents were more likely to justify Russia's war in Ukraine, to negate Russian responsibility and to blame Western countries for the war, even after controlling for ethnicity, while before February 2022 no measurable difference between Russian-speaking and other respondents can be found. 
We document that these shifts of opinion correspond to a significant increase in the consumption of Russian internet and social media content among Russian-speakers after February 2022, suggesting that this might be the channel through which Russian propaganda was effective. 
Finally, we show how consumers of Russian propaganda are more likely to support the war and condone the circumvention of sanctions against Russia, and document that war-relevant exports to Russia increased disproportionately in those Kazakh regions where citizens were more likely to consume Russian propaganda and condone the war.

Authoritarian Surveillance, Innovation and Growth
======
* With Torben Klarl, Michael Rochlitz and Matheus Eduardo Leusin
* We find that while the average effect of authoritarian institutions on innovation remains negative, in fields such as artificial intelligence, where large amounts of data are important, autocracies - under certain circumstances - can outperform competitive democracies.
