Innovation in AI
======
* Together with Torben Klarl, Michael Rochlitz and Matheus Leusin
* In this project, we try to analyse different technological trajectories of AI in different countries. We distinguish countries by their institutional frameworks (i.e. democracies vs. autocracies) and look whether there are systematic differences in AI innovation that can be linked back to existing institutions.

Chilling Effects of Digital Surveillance
======
* In this project I utilize list experiments (also known as item count technique) in order to find self-censorship induced by (digital) surveillance.
