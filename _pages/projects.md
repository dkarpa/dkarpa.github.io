Authoritarian Surveillance, Innovation and Growth
======
* With Torben Klarl, Michael Rochlitz and Matheus Eduardo Leusin
* We find that while the average effect of authoritarian institutions on innovation remains negative, in fields such as artificial intelligence, where large amounts of data are important, autocracies - under certain circumstances - can outperform competitive democracies.

Digital Surveillance and Self-censorship
======
* What are the consequences of online surveillance of citizens by governments?  Theory and previous research suggest that data surveillance practices have a chilling effect by discouraging citizens who are aware of data surveillance from engaging in legitimate digital communication behaviors, such as expressing opinions online (including low-threshold participation such as "liking") or searching for (sensitive) information online.
Drawing on an original survey experiment conducted in Kazakhstan in November 2023 (N=5,025), I show that citizens exposed to a text-based surveillance treatment reduce their response rate to sensitive questions by about 3% on average, while this effect is not triggered for non-sensitive questions. By comparing subgroups, I am able to identify conditional and heterogeneous treatment effects.
I calculate the social desirability bias induced by sensitive questions in questionnaires by comparing indirect and direct questions within a list experiment, and then show how the social desirability bias differs in magnitude and quality from the chilling effects induced by digital surveillance.
I contribute to the literature on digital authoritarianism by showing how common data surveillance practices undermine political discourse on the internet, which is crucial for democratic governance.


Effects of Russian language and media in Central-Asia
======
* With Andrey Tkachenko, Michael Rochlitz and Meruyert Tatkeyeva
* In this project we analyse the channels through which Russian propaganda influences the opinions of citizens in Central Asia. Among other things, we conduct experiments and work with survey data.
