<p>
Welcome!
</p>
<p>
I'm David, an applied economist specializing in the political economy of digital and automated governance. 
My research explores how political and economic institutions interact with technological change, 
with a particular focus on artificial intelligence and automation. 
I study algorithmic governance — especially how such systems are interpreted and understood by citizens. 
Using mixed empirical methods, I analyze attitudes, cognition, and behavior at the micro level. 
My work on <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00104140241290208">public support for surveillance</a> 
has been published in <em>Comparative Political Studies</em>.
</p>

<p>
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the 
<a href="https://www.sot.tum.de/en/sot/home/">TUM School of Social Sciences and Technology</a>, 
Technical University of Munich, where I work in the ERC-funded project 
<a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/projects/algorithmic-governance">
Algorithmic Governance – A Public Perspective (AGAPP)
</a>. 
In 2025, I held a postdoctoral fellowship at the 
<a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/networks/centre-social-data-science">
Centre for Social Data Science (CSDS)
</a> at the University of Helsinki. 
In 2024, I served as an adjunct professor at 
<a href="https://www.kimep.kz/college-of-social-sciences/kz/">
KIMEP University
</a> and completed my doctorate at the University of Bremen. 
In 2023, I was a visiting researcher at the 
<a href="https://ssh.nu.edu.kz/economics_about">
Department of Economics at Nazarbayev University
</a>.
</p>

<p>
I teach courses in political science and institutional economics, 
with a focus on technological development, as well as applied methods classes in R. 
You can learn more about my <a href="https://dkarpa.github.io/projects/">current research projects</a>
