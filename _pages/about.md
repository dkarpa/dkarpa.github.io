I am an aspiring economist doing research on AI and related topics. I am based at the University of Bremen and currently hold a PhD position at the Chair of Institutional Change of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelrochlitz/">Prof. Michael Rochlitz</a>.

My research focuses on the interplay between political institutions and innovation in artificial intelligence. More specifically, I am interested in the political economy of surveillance in authoritarian states and how to explain the rise of contemporary surveillance states. I am also interested in the psychology of surveillance, i.e. how the ubiquitous collection and analysis of data affects human cognition and behavior. Ongoing projects can be found <a href="https://dkarpa.github.io/projects/">here</a>.

I teach classes on institutional economics with a focus on AI. Previous teaching experience can be found <a href="https://dkarpa.github.io/teaching/">here</a>.
