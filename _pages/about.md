I am an applied economist researching the political economy of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00104140241290208">AI-powered surveillance and governance technologies</a> and their deployment in contemporary societies. I am based at the University of Helsinki where I work in the ERC-funded project <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/projects/algorithmic-governance">Algorithmic Governance - A Public Perspective (AGAPP)</a>. I received a PhD from the University of Bremen.

My research focuses on the interplay between political and economic institutions and AI. More specifically, I am interested algorithmic governance and how these tools are developed, cognized and influence preferences and behavior. I focus on the micro-side of things and look at individual decion-making and behavior. Most of my work includes randomized controlled trials. Ongoing projects can be found <a href="https://dkarpa.github.io/projects/">here</a>.

I mostly teach classes on institutional economics with a focus on AI, but I've also picked up teaching methods classes in R. Previous teaching experience can be found <a href="https://dkarpa.github.io/teaching/">here</a>.
