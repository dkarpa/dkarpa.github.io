Welcome! 
I’m David Karpa, an applied economist specializing in the political economy of digital and automated governance technologies. 
I’m currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki, where I contribute to the ERC-funded project <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/projects/algorithmic-governance">Algorithmic Governance - A Public Perspective (AGAPP)</a>. 
I completed my doctoral studies at the University of Bremen in 2024.

My work examines how political and economic institutions interact with technological development, specifically artificial intelligence and automation. 
I focus on algorithmic governance -- how these technologies are developed, understood, and shape individual decision-making. 
Using randomized controlled trials, I investigate the micro-level behaviors that drive these complex systems.
My work on <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00104140241290208">public support for surveillance</a> has been featured in Comparative Political Studies.

I primarily teach courses on political science and institutional economics with an emphasis on technological development, and I also offer applied methods classes in R.
