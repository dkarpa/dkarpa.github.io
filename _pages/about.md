I am an economist researching AI-powered surveillance and governance technologies and their deployment in contemporary societies. I am based at the University of Bremen and currently hold a PhD position at the Faculty of Economics.

My research focuses on the interplay between political and economic institutions and AI. More specifically, I am interested in the political economy of surveillance in authoritarian states and how to explain the rise of contemporary surveillance states. I am also interested in the psychology of surveillance, i.e. how the ubiquitous collection and analysis of data affects human cognition and behavior. Ongoing projects can be found <a href="https://dkarpa.github.io/projects/">here</a>.

I mostly teach classes on institutional economics with a focus on AI, but I've also picked up teaching methods classes in R. Previous teaching experience can be found <a href="https://dkarpa.github.io/teaching/">here</a>.
