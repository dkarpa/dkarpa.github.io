I am an economist researching AI and related topics. I am based at the University of Bremen, where I currently hold a position as a PhD-candidate at the chair of institutional change led by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelrochlitz/">Prof. Michael Rochlitz</a>. 

In my research, I focus on the interplay between political institutions and innovation in AI. More specifically, I focus on the political economy of surveillance in authoritarian states and how the rise the rise of contemporary surveillance states can be explained. I am moreover interested in the psychology of surveillance, i.e. how ubiquitous collection and analysis of data affects human cognition and behavior.

I teach classes on institutional economics with a focus on AI. Previous teaching experience can be found <a href="https://dkarpa.github.io/teaching/">here</a>.
