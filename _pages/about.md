<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>
I'm David, an applied economist specializing in the political economy of digital and automated governance.
My research explores how political and economic institutions interact with technological change,
with a particular focus on artificial intelligence and automation.
I study algorithmic governance — especially how such systems are interpreted and understood by citizens.
Using mixed empirical methods, I analyze attitudes, cognition, and behavior at the micro level.
My work on <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00104140241290208">public support for surveillance</a>  
has been published in <em>Comparative Political Studies</em>.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the
<a href="https://www.sot.tum.de/en/sot/home/">TUM School of Social Sciences and Technology</a>,
Technical University of Munich, where I work in the ERC-funded project
<a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101116772">Algorithmic Governance – A Public Perspective (AGAPP)</a>.
In 2025, I held a postdoctoral fellowship at the
<a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/networks/centre-social-data-science">Centre for Social Data Science (CSDS)</a>
at the University of Helsinki.
In 2024, I served as an adjunct professor at
<a href="https://www.kimep.kz/college-of-social-sciences/kz/">KIMEP University</a>
and completed my doctorate at the University of Bremen.
My dissertation received the
<a href="https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/university/university-communication-and-marketing/all-news/details/bremen-thesis-award-presented-1">Bremen Thesis Award</a>.
In 2023, I was a visiting researcher at the
<a href="https://ssh.nu.edu.kz/economics_about">Department of Economics at Nazarbayev University</a>.
</p>

<p>
I teach courses in political science and institutional economics,
with a focus on technological development, as well as applied methods classes in R.
