I am an economist researching the political economy of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00104140241290208">AI-powered surveillance and governance technologies</a> and their deployment in contemporary societies. I am based at the University of Bremen and currently hold a PhD position at the Faculty of Economics.

My research focuses on the interplay between political and economic institutions and AI. More specifically, I am interested algorithmic governance and how these tools are developed, cognized and influence preferences and behavior. Ongoing projects can be found <a href="https://dkarpa.github.io/projects/">here</a>.

I mostly teach classes on institutional economics with a focus on AI, but I've also picked up teaching methods classes in R. Previous teaching experience can be found <a href="https://dkarpa.github.io/teaching/">here</a>.
