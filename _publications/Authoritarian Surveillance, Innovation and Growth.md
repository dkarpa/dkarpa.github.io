excerpt: 'How do authoritarian political institutions influence the ability of an economy to innovate? The existing literature identifies a mostly negative effect of autocracy on innovation. In this paper, we build a theoretical model to investigate if this premise still holds in autocracies that rely on digital surveillance for political control, and that use the data obtained through surveillance as a subsidy for innovation in fields such as artificial intelligence. Our model illustrates the trade-off between the negative effect of surveillance on research and creativity, and the positive effect of the availability of large amounts of data. We find that while on average the effect of authoritarian institutions on innovation remains negative, in fields such as artificial intelligence where large amounts of data are important, autocracies can – under specific circumstances – achieve better results than competitive democracies.'
