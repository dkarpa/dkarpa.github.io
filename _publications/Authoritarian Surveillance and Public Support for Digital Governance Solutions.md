excerpt: 'What factors determine support for digital governance solutions? And do autocracies
differ from democracies in the way the population evaluates digitization initiatives
by the state? Building on previous studies, we hypothesize that gaps in the quality of
public services and information asymmetry between the government and the population
increase support, while exposure to information about potential abuse of such tools by
the state reduces support. We conducted a survey experiment with 2462 respondents
in Russia and complemented it with four survey experiments of 1000 respondents each
in Germany, Turkey, the United States and Estonia. We find strong and consistent
evidence that knowledge about the potential misuse of digital governance solutions reduces
support, irrespective of the type of political regime. Citizens who mostly rely
on government-controlled information are more likely to support the introduction of
digital governance tools. Contrary to previous studies, we do not find that gaps in the
quality of public services increase support. Instead, respondents who are satisfied with
the services provided by the state also seem to trust the government with introducing
a digital governance solution.'
