## Understanding Support for Algorithmic Governance in Autocracies

Algorithmic governance systems (AGS)—facial recognition, automated decision-making, digital monitoring, and data-driven public administration—are spreading rapidly across the globe. China has become a global leader in exporting such systems under its “Digital Silk Road,” and Central Asia is one of the key destination regions. Kazakhstan, in particular, has emerged as an enthusiastic adopter.

AGS offer a dual promise:

- **Governance benefits:** reduced corruption, more efficient public services, faster bureaucratic processes  
- **Repressive risks:** enhanced state surveillance, reduced civic freedoms, and the capacity to preempt dissent  

To understand how citizens in an autocratic or semi-authoritarian context evaluate these trade-offs, we fielded a **nationally matched survey experiment in Kazakhstan in March 2025 (N = 3,124)** in collaboration with NAC Analytica.

Our central question is straightforward:  
### **Under what conditions do people support algorithmic governance—and when do they reject it as a tool of political control?**

---

## The Kazakhstani Context

Kazakhstan is uniquely well suited for studying public reactions to AGS:

- It is **rapidly digitizing**, adopting Chinese smart-city and surveillance technologies.
- It sits **between democratization and entrenched autocracy**, with uncertain institutional futures.
- It borders Xinjiang, where AGS has been used for **severe repression**—including against ethnic Kazakhs.
- It faces well-known **institutional gaps**, above all corruption.

This combination makes Kazakhstan an especially informative case for understanding how citizens weigh the governance promises and political risks of algorithmic systems.

## Experimental Design

We implemented a **2 × 6 factorial survey experiment**:

- **Six framings** describing potential uses of AGS:  
  - corruption  
  - religious fundamentalism  
  - public security  
  - social trust  
  - public health  
  - no justification (pure control)

- **Crossed with a repression cue**:  
  - “These technologies can also be used to target protesters or journalists.”

This created **12 experimental conditions**, allowing us to isolate:
1. **Which institutional gaps increase support**  
2. **How support changes when the possibility of political repression is made salient**

Respondents then evaluated their **support for AGS** on a 4-point scale.

## Institutional Gaps: What Problems Do Citizens Perceive?

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/descriptive_gaps.jpg" title="Perceived institutional gaps in Kazakhstan" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>

Corruption stands out as the most salient institutional gap, with nearly 90% of respondents seeing it as a problem.  
Low social trust and crime are also widely perceived as challenges, while extremism and public health issues are somewhat less pressing.

These perceptions help explain why AGS—which are often presented as modernizing solutions—receive such high baseline support.

## High Baseline Support for AGS

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/descriptive_approval_only_control_gaps.jpg" title="Baseline approval for AGS by framing (no repression cue)" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>

Even without any justification, **78% of respondents somewhat approve or fully approve** of AGS.  
This level of enthusiasm resembles support in China and is noticeably higher than what we have found in other countries (including Russia).

Institutional framings raise support **only modestly**, but corruption and religious fundamentalism emerge as the most compelling rationales.

---

## Effects of Institutional Gap Framings

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-12 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/ATE_no_cov_and_cov.jpg" title="Average treatment effects of institutional gap framings" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>

Corruption and extremism framings generate small but consistent positive effects—even starting from a very high baseline.  
Kazakhstani respondents appear to view AGS as particularly suitable for addressing these two challenges.

---

## The Repression Cue: A Meaningful but Limited Backlash

We now turn to the central tension in the study:  
**How do citizens react when reminded that AGS can be used for political repression?**

### Average effect  
📉 Support drops by **5.9 percentage points**.

This suggests that even in semi-authoritarian contexts, people do care about civil liberties.  
However, the effect is **much smaller** than the 24-point decline we documented in Russia in 2022.

## How Repression Shapes Support Across Framings

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-12 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/ATE_contrast_rep_and_control.jpg" title="Effects of repression cue contrasted with control" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>

Most groups reduce their support when repression is highlighted.  
But the average hides substantial heterogeneity.

---

## Heterogeneity: When Do People *Welcome* Repression?

Some findings challenge standard theoretical expectations.

For several groups, making repression explicit **increases** support for AGS:

- **Residents of Almaty and Astana** show a strong positive reaction when corruption and repression are combined.  
- **Russian-speaking minorities** disapprove of repression in general but *support* it when framed as targeting corruption.  
- **Religious respondents** increase support when repression is paired with anti-extremism messaging.

This leads to a central insight:

### **For some citizens, repression is not a cost of AGS—it is a benefit.**

## Summary of Conditional Treatment Effects

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-12 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/CATE_combined.jpg" title="Conditional treatment effects across social groups" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>

Several patterns emerge:

- Support for AGS is **highest among** Muslims, Kazakh-speakers, high-trust individuals, and ethnic Kazakhs.  
- Corruption remains a compelling rationale **even when paired with repression**, especially for Russian-speakers and non-Muslims.  
- Some groups appear to endorse “targeted repression” as a legitimate state response to corruption.

These results complicate the idea of a simple repression–legitimacy trade-off.

---

## A Puzzle: Why Does Repression Sometimes Increase Support?

Our findings point to a theoretically important puzzle:

### **Under certain conditions, political repression increases support for algorithmic governance.**

This contradicts standard models that assume support should decline monotonically when repression is made salient.

Possible explanations include:

- A desire for order and discipline in a context of institutional decay  
- Perceptions that repression is justified if targeted at “bad actors”  
- Trust in the Kazakhstani state to use AGS for the public good  
- Soviet or post-Soviet political socialization  
- A belief that digital governance is modernizing and therefore desirable even if illiberal  

Existing survey data cannot fully resolve these mechanisms.

## Next Steps: Qualitative Interviews

To better understand **why some citizens welcome algorithmic repression**, we are now collecting:

- **Semi-structured interviews in Almaty and Astana**  
- **Focus groups with Kazakh-speaking and Russian-speaking communities**  

These qualitative data will help clarify:

- How people draw the line between regulation and repression  
- When punitive state action is seen as legitimate  
- How AGS become symbolically attached to modernization, fairness, or state strength  

This evidence will inform the next stage of the project.

## Preliminary Evidence & Outlook

This project offers the first experimental evidence on how institutional gap framings and repression cues shape support for algorithmic governance in a Central Asian autocracy.

Key takeaways:

- **Baseline support is extremely high** (78%).  
- **Corruption** is the most powerful justification for AGS adoption.  
- **Repression reduces support overall**, but the effect is limited.  
- **Crucially, some groups increase their support when repression is highlighted.**

This last finding raises one of the most intriguing questions for the political economy of digital governance:

### **Why do some citizens welcome algorithmic repression, and under what conditions?**

We are now conducting follow-up interviews to better understand this puzzle.

More results soon.
