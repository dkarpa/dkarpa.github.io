## Understanding Support for Algorithmic Governance in Autocracies

Algorithmic governance systems (AGS) — such as facial recognition, automated decision-making, digital monitoring, and large-scale data integration — are rapidly spreading across developing and authoritarian states. 
Kazakhstan, a key hub in China’s **Digital Silk Road**, is one of the earliest and most enthusiastic adopters.

AGS offer a dual promise:

- **Governance benefits:** reduced corruption, more efficient public services, faster bureaucracy  
- **Political risks:** expanded surveillance, limits on civic freedoms, and tools for targeted repression  

To understand how citizens evaluate these trade-offs, we conducted a **nationally matched online survey experiment (N = 3,124)** in March 2025 with NAC Analytica.

Our central question:

### **When do citizens welcome algorithmic governance — and when do they fear it as a tool of political control?**

## Experimental Design: A 2×6 Factorial Structure

We implemented a **2 × 6 experiment**, crossing six message framings with an orthogonal repression cue.

This design allows us to estimate:

1. **How different institutional gaps affect support for AGS**  
2. **How repression cues reshape attitudes**, and  
3. **Which groups welcome or resist algorithmic repression**

# 1. Institutional Gaps in Kazakhstan

The first step is understanding which problems citizens perceive as most severe.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-12 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/combined_results_gaps.jpg" title="Gap perceptions, approval patterns, and institutional-gap treatment effects" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>

### Key insights:

- **Corruption dominates** public concern — nearly 90% see it as a major problem.  
- Security and trust gaps are also salient.  
- Epidemics and radicalization still matter, but less intensely.

Despite this variation, **support for AGS is extremely high** across all framings:  
even in the pure control group, **78% approve**.

This baseline support resembles levels in China and exceeds those in Russia, Eastern Europe, and OECD democracies.

---

# 2. Do Institutional Gaps Increase Support for AGS?

We next estimate **average treatment effects (ATEs)** of each institutional-gap framing relative to the control.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-12 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/ATE_no_cov_and_cov.jpg" title="Average treatment effects of institutional gaps (with and without covariates)" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>

### What do we learn?

- **Corruption** and **radicalization** framings generate the strongest increases in support.  
- Other gaps (security, trust, epidemics) generate **little or no average effect**.  
- All effects are modest because baseline support is already extremely high.

Still, citizens clearly see AGS as particularly appropriate for addressing **corruption** and **extremism** — two politically sensitive issues in Kazakhstan.

---

# 3. The Repression Cue: A Limited but Meaningful Backlash

We now introduce the key tension:

### **How do citizens react when reminded that AGS can be used against protesters or journalists?**

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-12 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/ags_int_pred_bin.jpg" title="Predicted support for AGS under control vs repression cue" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>

### Findings:

- Repression reduces support by **5.9 percentage points** on average.  
- This shows that even in a semi-authoritarian context, many citizens value civic freedoms.  
- Yet the decline is **far smaller** than the 24-point drop we observed in Russia (2022).

Importantly, repression **does not reduce support uniformly** across all groups or framings.  
For some combinations, repression *increases* support — a striking deviation from standard political-economy models.

This leads us to the final section.

---

# 4. Heterogeneous Effects: When Do People *Welcome* Repression?

One of the most surprising results is that certain groups **increase** their support for AGS when repression is made explicit.

The clearest example involves residents of Kazakhstan’s two largest cities:

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-12 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/CATE_urban.jpg" title="Conditional effects for residents of Almaty and Astana" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>

### Key takeaways:

- **Urban residents (Almaty & Astana)** show the **highest baseline support**.  
- When corruption is paired with repression, support **increases dramatically** — by about **0.5 points on a 4-point scale**.  
- This is a surprisingly large effect.

Across additional subgroups (not shown here):

- **Russian-speakers** reject repression in most domains —  
  **except when repression targets corruption**, which they strongly support.
- **Religious respondents** show increased support when repression is tied to counter-extremism.
- **High-trust individuals** remain supportive irrespective of repression cues.

### Interpretation:

For some citizens, repression is **not a cost** of AGS —  
### **it is a feature.**

This complicates the standard assumption that repression uniformly reduces support for digital governance tools.

---

# Conclusion

This study provides the first experimental evidence on how institutional-gap framings and repression cues shape support for algorithmic governance in a Central Asian autocracy.

### Main findings:

- **Baseline support for AGS is extremely high** (78%).  
- **Corruption** is the strongest institutional rationale for AGS adoption.  
- **Repression cues reduce support**, but only slightly.  
- **Some groups welcome algorithmic repression** when it targets perceived societal “threats.”  

These results challenge the conventional repression–legitimacy trade-off model.  
In Kazakhstan, support for digital governance does not always decline when authoritarian risks are highlighted.  
Under certain conditions, **algorithmic repression becomes politically acceptable — even desirable.**

We are now conducting follow-up qualitative interviews in Almaty and Astana to understand **why**.

More results soon.
